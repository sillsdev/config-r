[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

> :warning: We ship this as part of our [product](https://github.com/BloomBooks/BloomDesktop), but some features (search and nested screens) have not made it to production yet. In addition, we may make visual changes over time. Finally, the only documentation is the code and the storybook stories.
